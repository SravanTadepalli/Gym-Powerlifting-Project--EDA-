# Gym Powerlifting Project - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze powerlifting performance data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to strength training. The analysis leverages Python for data visualization and statistical analysis to help athletes optimize their training programs.

## 📊 Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Data Visualization & EDA Techniques

## 📈 Key Insights & Findings

Performance Trends: Analyzing progress over time.

Weight Class Impact: Examining performance differences across weight classes.

Gender-Based Strength Differences: Comparing male and female powerlifting records.

Lift Ratios: Analyzing the ratio between squat, bench press, and deadlift.

Wilks Score Insights: Identifying the most efficient lifters based on weight-adjusted performance.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

Implement predictive modeling to estimate future lifting progress.

Develop an interactive dashboard for tracking performance trends.
